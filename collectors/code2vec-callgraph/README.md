# Code2Vec CallGraph

This collector represents each codebase as a set of methods, grouped by packages and classes, that are represented with their signature, which contains the name of the method and its parameters. Besides the signature, each method is also represented by its type, a list of all methods invoked there, and a numerical vector generated by the Code2Vec model to represent that method.

Given the path for the codebase to analyze, the collector starts to search every file with the .java extension.

For each method found, the respective body is used to invoke the Code2Vec model service present in the Fast API Server, which return the respective code vector.
